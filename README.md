# Portfolio

My professional portfolio showcasing projects I have worked on. I started my portfolio using plain HTML and CSS, but I have since moved to using React and Next.js. This better follows DRY principles and allows me to use React components to create a more dynamic portfolio.

This is a CI repository, meaning that changes to the main branch are automatically tested and deployed.

## Getting Started

Installing the packages:
```bash
npm install
```

Running the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Building for production:
```bash
npm run build
# or
yarn build
```
