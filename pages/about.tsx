            <h1>About</h1>
            <p>
                I'm a Computer Science graduate from the University of Michigan.
                I've taken classes in game design, computer vision, software
                engineering, philosophy, and others. In my free time I write
                code, implement fun & interesting ideas, bike, ski, play games
                with friends, and cook good food.
            </p>
